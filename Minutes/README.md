# Minutes from 10/05/2016
## Tenders
Due on May 15th.

- Split into

- Methodology (Kyle)
- Team (Each person does their own) - Get this done by tomorrow night for the STDs.
- Short team description x3 (Josh, Keegan, Dorothy)
- Overall layout (Jason)

The descriptions and STDs need to be done per-project:

- IoT (Dorothy)

## Github and Website
We're buying albertprime.co.za to make a team website. (Hosted by Keegan and Kyle). \
Zenhub will be used for project management, scrum boards etc. \
We'll add a linter to github for coding standards.

## Coding Standards
For functions, the code should look like 
```
/**
 * Javadocs
**/
function () {
// Code
}
```
You can write this as you want though, the linter will clean it up when you commit.

JavaDocs (Or whatever for the language we use) should be used - parameter and return types should be documented, as well as the function description if necessary. 

At the top of the file at least the following should be added:

- Description/Intent of file.
- Date last edited.

## Positions
1. Keegan - Project Manager and Client Talker.
2. Jason - Secretary and Group Leader.
3. Dorothy - Motivational speaker.
4. Josh - Gandalf, creative design.
5. Kyle - Github owner, coffee maker and name chooser.
