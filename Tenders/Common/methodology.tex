We value the relationship formed between the client and our team and the importance of having a good relationship. So much in fact that we would want to include throught the whole process of building your project by presenting demos and working with you on the feedback; letting you know how far we are from completion and what we have accomplished over each week. This all forms just one part of the methodology we've chosen to development your project. The agile method. Specifically, feature driven development. One of the great things about the agile methods is that it allows us to respond to change very quickly. So if you have any ideas halfway through the process we will be able to incorporate them into the final product in one form or another. We will begin by developing an overall model of the system. The model will represent our solution and how we intend to develop it. Once we have agreed upon the system model we can begin working on the feature list. This list will contain all the features you wish your project to have. We will ranks each as either a major or minor feature and begin working through such accordingly. For each feature we intend to develop a plan to construct the feature. Latsly, develop the feature. As we go through we'll go through each feature on the feature list we'll create the plan, develop the feature and move to the next feature. We believe this will provide the best experience for communication and producing your product.
