	\section{Project Overview}

	\textbf{Our Vision}\\
	Our vision of this project is a very easy to use, web based, interpreted programming language. We see this tool as a way for people, 
    who may not be able to code, to write there own, short mathematical programs. It is important that this part of the tool be treated as
    any interpreter program would. Implementing typical interpreter components, such and lexical analysis and syntax analysis, is important
    to ensure that the libraries and packages, written by the user, preform in a reliable and consistent manner, such that the user can 
    trust whatever output their functions return. \\
    
	\textbf{Our Vision}\\    
    Our plan is try and write the interpreter in such a way that it can be run in either python
    or JavaScript on the client's side, to ensure that output is produced and displayed as fast as possible, as well as remove pressure 
    from the server. However, we do see this interpreter possibly getting to larger to pass through to the client, depending on what 
    functionality is already implemented for the user (mathematical operations, control structures, etc.), so running the interpreter on the
    server side may be the best option in order to keep the web tool light weight. \\

	\textbf{Goals and Requirements}\\
    It is also extremely important that the web tool is easy to learn and use, as it will be used primarily by people who do not necessarily
    understand computer programming. We do not want to overwhelm new users with too many options that they may not understand, but at the 
    same time we do want to provide them with all the tools that they could possibly need to create any function, as well as provide them 
    with any all the information, about their libraries, that they could need. This is where we see UI design being important. We will need 
    to create the website in such as way that users will be able to find whatever they may want easily and without getting confused and 
    frustrated. Our team fully believes in good, intuitive GUI design that will make the users feeling comfortable when using our software.
    We would like to make use of a popular HTML/CSS framework, such as materialize CSS, to give the final product a very clean and modern look,
    well also speeding up our production time. We would also plan to do multiple usability tests towards the end of our development, to ensure
    that potential users will feel comfortable, and that we have succeeded in making the application intuitive for the users. \\

	\textbf{Backend Technologies}\\
    It is important that all user information be stored in a safe an efficient manner on the back-end, and that information retrieval be fast. 
    That is why we propose making use of the MEAN stack when creating the server and database. The MEAN stack will allow us to create a fast, 
    custom, web-server to handle and request that the user may have. Such requests would include, logging into the users account, fetching 
    libraries that the user may currently be working on, exploring other users libraries and profiles, etc. A mongo database will allow for 
    extremely fast data retrieval allowing the server to respond to more requests in a shorter time than a LAMP stack implementation. A MEAN 
    stack implementation will allow us create a separate gateway for external components to access the libraries created by uses, as mentioned
    in the original brief.\\

	\textbf{Additional Features}\\
    A possible potential feature that we would like to add to this tool, is the ability to download libraries and packages as a Java, C++ or Python class. The user would simply create and test the library on the web application and then select an option to download it as a programming
    language class. The library would then be sent to the NodeJS server, which would translate the graph into a class, and return the file to 
    the user. Users could also download any public libraries that someone else has implemented, to use in their own programs. The would not be 
    such a tough feature to implement if we treat this application as an interpreter, as we will just be translating code. This feature will 
    allow programmers the ability to quickly write and test mathematical functions which they can the use in their programs. This could help 
    attract more users which a different skill set to the site. \\

	\textbf{Compiler}\\
    Two of our members have both completed the compiler construction course at the University of Pretoria, and will be able to apply 
    the knowledge gained from building a compiler into building the necessary components needed for the interpreter component of this project. 
    It is important that this is done correctly to ensure that no unexpected errors or crashes occur when a user is testing their 
    created library. Although this may be seen as a very basic interpreter, it will still be important to implement all the necessary 
    components of an interpreter/compiler to ensure that, even as functions and projects get larger, the user can still be sure that they are
    getting reliable and consistent results, without running the risk of potentially crashing the NodeJS server. It will also give us the 
    ability of being able to add more basic, such as if statements and loops, with little effort.\\
    
	\textbf{Frontend and Backend}\\
    Every member of our team has experience with working on front-end and back-end web development. This is necessary for this project 
    as our vision for the final product would involve much of what the user is seeing, being done on the client's side, as well as having
    administrative tasks, being worked on on the back-end. The front-end needs aesthetically pleasing as well as being easy to use and intuitive,
    well the back-end needs to be secure, safe, and reliable to ensure that no personal data is lost and that the web server stays up 
    and running at all times. Each member has experience working with the MEAN stack giving us the advantage of not needing to relearn the
    the technologies used in a MEAN stack implementation.\par

    Finally, each member of our team is a skilled mathematician, having completed calculus, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics courses.
    This means we will not have any trouble implementing and testing the mathematical logic. We will be able to account for any possible need
    that a user may have, such as binary mathematics, discrete mathematics, or linear algebra operations.\\
