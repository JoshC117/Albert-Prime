# COS 301
## Albert Prime - Tender Documents

### Compilation
Needs to be compiled with XeTeX rather than the standard PDFLaTeX (Because PDFLaTeX doesn't support modern fonts). TexMaker has this built in, not sure about the other editors. Also works in ShareLatex.\
Needs to have the [lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) fonts installed.

### Directory Structure
The only files needed per-tender are the main.tex files and the cover image. The content page, title page and other stuff is all in Common.
