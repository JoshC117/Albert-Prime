\section{Specific Requirements}
	This section starts off by outlining the specific requirements for each external interface, followed by a description of the function requirements. It then continues with the performance requirements and design constraints, as well as the the attributes or non-functional requirements of the system. Finally, any other requirements not under the preceding categories are listed.
	\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
%	Detailed description for each system interfaces, user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces and communication interfaces. Include input and output, name, format, valid range, timing and other information.
	
	\subsection{Functional Requirements}
%	Detailed description of the functionality of each functional requirement. "The system shall do/perform/provide ...".	May include input validity checks, sequence of operations, responses to abnormal situations, input-output relationships.
