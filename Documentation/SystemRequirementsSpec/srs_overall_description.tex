\section{Overall Description}
	This section will provide an overview of the systems functionality and it's interaction with other systems. This chapter will also outline the users of the system and their interaction, as well as the development constraints and assumptions made.
	\subsection{Product Perspective}
	%The context of the product. The characteristics and limits on the primary and secondary memory, modes of operations, backup and recovery, and site specific requirements.

	\paragraph{System Interfaces}
	\textit{Empty for now.}
	\paragraph{User Interfaces}
	\textit{Will be expanded upon}\\
	The user interface primarily makes use of a drag-and-drop component based system. Each component acts as a function which can be made up of further components. Users add components in to a work-space where they can add links between components by dragging from one component's input or output nodes to those of another component.\\
	
	The navbars and other sections of the interface are all stylized with Materialize, so as to have a unified theme and styling. These navbars will contain the functionality needed to handle the management of the components created using the system.\\
	\textit{This part of the interface will be expanded upon further into the project.}
