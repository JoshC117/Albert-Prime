					      	<p>Currently in my final year of studying BSc Computer Science. I am an aspiring software developer with a love for mathematics and problem solving. I am a passionate programmer who is excited to develop my skills and knowledge. I enjoy taking on leadership roles and pushing myself with exciting and large projects.</p><br>
					      	<p>I have launched a website designed and development business, <a href="www.unhinged.co.za">unhinged.co.za</a> , with another team mate Kyle Erwin. My role in the business is mostly backend development and running the business's accounting, however our vision is to one day extend into larger, and more complex projects, which we hope with this give up the experience to do.</p><br>
					      	<p>During my free time I enjoy working on my Android app development skills, experimenting with physical computing (skilled with using Raspberry Pis and Arduinos), as well as competing in various programming and problem solving contests. Some contests that I have completed are: Standard Bank IT Challenge 2016 and 2017, ACM 2016, and HackFu challenge 2016.</p>

					We value the relationship formed between the client and our team and the importance of having a good relationship. So much in fact that we would want to include throught the whole process of building your project by presenting demos and working with you on the feedback; letting you know how far we are from completion and what we have accomplished over each week.</p>

            		<p> This all forms just one part of the methodology we've chosen to development your project. The agile method. Specifically, feature driven development. One of the biggest advantages about this is that we can quickly and easily incorporate feedback into the system.</p>

            		<p> We will begin by developing an overall model of the system. The model will represent our solution and how we intend to develop it. Once we have agreed upon the system model we can begin working on the feature list. This list will contain all the features you wish your project to have. We will ranks each as either a major or minor feature and begin working through such accordingly. For each feature we intend to develop a plan to construct the feature.</p>

		      	<h4>Why Albert Prime?</h4>
		      	<p>Our team consists of a set of people with enough skills to complete this project sufficiently and then some. We are all sufficiently competent in MEAN stack.</p> <br>
		      	<p>Keegan is our resident Raspberry Pi expert. He has a passion for Raspberry Pi and works with them on a regular basis. This will aid the development of this system as one of the requirements is to program a Raspberry Pi to gather the data from the devices around the house.</p> <br>
		      	<p>As third year Computer Science Students, we know a number of programming languages. It is worth mentioning that Jason is very fluent in Python amongst other languages. It will be an asset to your system to have someone with his expertise working on it.</p> <br>
		      	<p>Application development is one of our strong points. The mobile application needed for the caretaker communication and control of devices will make use of our skills. Joshua and Keegan's experience with iOS and Android development and his passion for mobile application development amongst others will be put to great use with this system.</p> <br>
		      	<p>This system will require creativity and and a good understanding of cloud servers. The Rabbiteer program Dimpho attended in 2016 focused a lot on this. This project will be an opportunity to develop these skills and her success in the Standard bank IT challenge shows her creative capability and competence.</p> <br>
		      	<p>Kyle is very passionate about Artificial Intelligence which is always a useful skill in today's age. This system could use his passion and skill for the monitoring and learning the user's patterns such that if anything seems out of place, the caregivers can notified.</p> <br>
		      	<p>All 5 group members are talented developers. Above are a few of the skills we have to offer but our skills are not limited to what is mentioned above. We are all hardworking fast learners and willing to learn any new technologies and skills needed to make this system a successful one.</p>

		      	<p>Two of our memembers have both completed the compiler construction course at the University of Pretoria, and will be able to apply 
			    the knowledge gained from building a compiler into building the necessary components needed for the interpreter component of this project. 
			    It is important that this is done correctly to ensure that no unexpected errors or crashes occur when a user is testing their 
			    created library. Although this may be seen as a very basic interpreter, it will still be important to implement all the necessary 
			    components of an interpreter/compiler to ensure that, even as functions and projects get larger, the user can still be sure that they are
			    getting reliable and consistant results, without running the risk of potentially crashing the node.js server. It will also give us the 
			    ability of being able to add more basic, such as if statements and loops, with little effort.</p> <br>
		      	<p>Every member of our team has experience with working on front-end and back-end web development. This is necessary for this project 
			    as our vision for the final product would involve much of what the user is seeing, being done on the client's side, as well as having
			    admistrative tasks, being worked on on the back-end. The front-end needs aesthetically pleasing as well as being easy to use and intuitive,
			    well the back-end needs to be secure, safe, and reliable to ensure that no personal data is lost and that the web server stays up 
			    and running at all times. Each member has experience working with the MEAN stack giving us the advantage of not needing to relearn the
			    the thechnologies used in a MEAN stack implementation.</p> <br>
		      	<p>Finally, each member of our team is a skilled mathematician, having completed calculus, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics courses.
			    This means we will not have any trouble implementing and testing the mathematical logic. We will be able to account of any possible need
			    that a user may have, such as binary mathematics, discrete mathematics, or linear algebra operations.</p>
